\# Reddit Client Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. It serves as a client for interacting with Reddit's public API, providing a smooth user experience for browsing and searching posts.

\## Features

\- \*\*Modern Frontend Architecture\*\*: Built with Create React App and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.

\- \*\*Interactive UI\*\*: The app reloads dynamically as you make changes.

\- \*\*Error Handling\*\*: Provides helpful linting and debugging outputs during development.

\- \*\*Optimized for Production\*\*: Creates a minified and optimized build ready for deployment.

\---

\## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

\### `npm start`

\- Launches the app in development mode.

\- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

\- The app will reload automatically if you make edits.

\- Displays any linting or runtime errors in the console.

\### `npm test`

\- Starts the interactive test runner.

\- For more information, refer to [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

\### `npm run build`

\- Creates a production-ready build in the `build` folder.

\- Optimizes React code for best performance.

\- Files are minified, and filenames include hashes for caching.

Refer to the [Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for instructions on how to deploy the app.

\### `npm run eject`

\*\*Caution: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t undo it.\*\*

\- If you need full control of the build configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can `eject`.

\- The configuration files and dependencies will be moved into your project, enabling advanced customization.

\- All other scripts (`npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build`) will remain functional.

\> Use `eject` only if absolutely necessary. For most projects, the curated build setup is sufficient.
